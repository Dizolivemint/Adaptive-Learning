# Adaptive Learning Platform for Technical Training

## Project Overview
This project aims to design an innovative learning platform tailored to individual learning styles and needs. By integrating a variety of learning algorithms such as spaced repetition, active recall, and dual coding, the platform leverages AI-driven personalization to adapt to each user's unique learning preferences. Our goal is to offer a diverse range of content formats, including text, video, and interactive simulations, to cater to different learning modalities.
